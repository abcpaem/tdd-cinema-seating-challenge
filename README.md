# TDD exercise for a cinema seating challenge.
Test Driven Development exercise for the Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre Seating Challenge.

### What is the goal?

Develop a program to allocate seats to customers purchasing tickets for a movie theatre under the following criteria:
- Well-designed and tested code representing real-world scenarios
- Evidence of Test-Driven Development being applied
- Clear communication and documentation

### Business Requirements

The Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre has 15 seats, arranged in 3 rows of 5
- Rows are assigned a letter from A to C
- Seats are assigned a number from 1 to 5

### User Story
*As a Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre Manager*<br>
*I want to allocate seats to customers*<br>
*So that I can control reserved seating for the theatre*

**GIVEN** a customer wants to request some tickets<br>
**WHEN** they request a number of seats between 1 and 3 for a movie<br>
**THEN** the customer should be allocated the required number of seats<br>
from the available seats on the seating plan<br>
**AND** the seats should be recorded as allocated

### Acceptance Criteria and Assumptions
- Write a program that allocates seats based on a random integer “number of seats” between 1 and 3.
- Your program should allocate the required number of seats from the available seats starting from seat A1 and filling the auditorium from left to right, front to back.
- All the seats are available for sale when the program starts.
- The program should continue to allocate a random number of seats until it finds there are not enough seats left to complete the request.
- Once there are not enough seats available to be allocated then the program can halt.

## Solution

Let's start by drawing a user case diagram to have a graphical description of the user interaction with the ticketing system:

<img src="/docs/UserCaseDiagram.png" width="500">

The user will:
- Look at the seating plan.
- Request a maximum of 3 tickets.
- Wait for the system to allocate the seats.
- View the allocated tickets.

The following flow diagram will show in more detail the steps followed to allocate tickets:

<img src="/docs/FlowchartDiagram.png" width="500">

As you can see, the system will:
- Show the seating plan.
- Allocate tickets as long as they are available, otherwise it will stop the booking process.
- Show the allocated tickets.
- Wait for user to request more tickets.

### Class Diagram
The following diagram will map out the structure of the ticketing system by modeling its classes, attributes, operations and relationships between objects:

<img src="/docs/ClassDiagram.png" width="980">

These are the assumptions and considerations:
- The purpose of the ticketing system is to allocate seats requested by a customer, therefore:
    - There is a *Customer* class that contains the seats allocated for a specific customer.
    - The allocated tickets can be added, removed or fetched from the customer.
- There is one abstract class called *Venue*, which:
    - Contains the basic information for a venue, like name, capacity and seating plan.
    - Implements the *VenueBehaviour*, which contains methods to interact with the venue.
    - Can be extended by any type of venue.
    - It contains a property called *autoAllocate* that indicates the automatic allocation of seats, meaning that the customer cannot select the seats.
- The *Cinema* class is a specific type of venue, where:
    - Its seating plan is formed by rows and a number of seats in those rows. 
    - The identifiers of the rows and the number of seats will be passed at creation time.
    - It will automatically create the seating plan at construction time.
- The *Seat* class:
    - Will be used by *Cinema* and *Customer* as seat lists for the seating plan and the allocated seats respectively.
    - Contains a property called *isAllocated* that indicates if the seat has been allocated to a customer or not.
    - Contains the row name and seat number for the seat.

## Test Driven Development process

The TDD approach will start with the simplest case scenario, then it will grow in complexity until all the requirements have been satisfied:

1) Add test to check the Cinema name. See test [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResults01.html).
2) Add test to check the Cinema capacity. See test [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResults02.html).
3) Refactors TicketingTests to apply DRY principle. See all tests passing [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResults03.html).
4) Add test to check the Cinema seating plan. See test [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResults04.html).
5) Add test to check if the Cinema has seats available. See test [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResults05.html).
6) Add test to check if the Cinema will allocate seats automatically. See test [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResults06.html).
7) Add test to allocate one seat for a customer. See test [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResults07.html).
8) Add test to allocate two seats for a customer. See test [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResults08.html).
9) Add test to allocate three seats for a customer. See test [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResults09.html).
10) Refactor seats allocation for one customer. See test [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResults10.html).
11) Add test to check multiple seats allocation with different customers. See test [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResults11.html).

Finally, you can see all the tests passing [here](https://htmlview.glitch.me/?https://github.com/abcpaem/tdd-cinema-seating-challenge/blob/main/docs/TestResultsAll.html).

### Class Diagram (Version 2)

During the process of writing the tests and implementing all the classes and interfaces needed for the solution, there were some minor changes from the original design, so here is the version 2 of the class diagram: 

<img src="/docs/ClassDiagramV2.png" width="980">

This is the list of changes:
- In the *VenueBehaviour* interface:
  - The method *showSeatingPlan* was replaced for *getSeatingPlan* to return a list of seats instead of void, which was originally thought as a way to print the seating plan.
  - A new parameter of type *Customer* was added to the *allocateSeats* method in order to add the allocated seats to the customer.
- In the *Venue* class, the attribute *autoFill* was renamed to *autoAllocate* to reflect a better naming for its use.
- In the *Customer* class:
  - The name was removed as it is not relevant at this point.
  - The attribute *allocatedSeats* was renamed to just *seats*.
  - Only 2 methods were needed, one for adding a seat and another to get all the allocated seats from a customer.
- The *Seat* class only contains in the methods section:
  - The getter and setter for the *isAllocated* attribute.
  - The overriding of the method *toString()* so it can show the seat as a string concatenation of the row and seat number.
